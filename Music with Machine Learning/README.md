# Music-with-Machine-Learning

A Data Analysis Project that uses Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques to cluster waveform and spectrogram music data into genres.

My Contribution: Used numpy to implement K-mean clustering Algorithm, Performed PCA and K-Means on spectogram data. Used OpenCV for image processing steps.
